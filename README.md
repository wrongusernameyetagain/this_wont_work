Hi, I'm Paul and I want to show some tips and tricks for SQL reporting, with stuff for Metabase and Tableau.

You'll find some basic internal reporting ideas / queries on metabase_analytics and tableau_analytics.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-lipsitz-81b71b89/?locale=en_US )
Cheers!
