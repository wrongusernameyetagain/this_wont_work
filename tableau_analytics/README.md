Folder containing basic Tableau server analytics.

**workbook_explorer** 
* Shows all workbooks within given folders on Tableau server, and offers extra functions as "data freshness" and enriched searching by tag/description/name.

**download_actions**
* Tableau server doesn't recognize export/download actions as "workbook events", so this offers results based on HTTP requests done to the server. Useful to see which users are exporting data, and how frequently
