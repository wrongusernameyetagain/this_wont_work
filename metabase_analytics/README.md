Queries to check user analytics when using Metabase
--

If you're running a Metabase instance and are wondering how users are using the dashboards you've created, these are some queries for you
*  user_activity will help identify power-users, responsible for the highest amount of 'pageviews' for dashboards.
*  top_dashboards_with_users_breakdown returns the most visited dashboards, and the amount of distinct users each one got.
*  top_10_dashboards_per_visits also returns most visited dashboards, over total views.
